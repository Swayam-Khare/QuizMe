A Quiz App made with Java in Android Studio as a Personal Project

This is a personal project I made to implement whatever I learned in Android Programming.
The app uses java for the logic part and SQLite to store the questions. 
I have also included the apk if you want to try out the app in your own Android device, it is placed in the apk directory.

To set up the project in your environment:
1. Make sure you have Android Studio installed in it.
1. Make sure you have JDK 11 or latest installed in it.
1. Fork the repository.
1. clone the repo in your local machine.
1. Opem Android Studio and Open the cloned project.
1. Wait for the Gradle build to finish.
1. Resolve the errors, if any.
1. You're good to go
